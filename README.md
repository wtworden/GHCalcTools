# GHCalcTools
Tools for visualizing Multi-variable calculus concepts using Rhino and Grasshopper.

The main tool is surface_plotter, which is a 3D graphing calculator that has features that were added in the course of teaching a multi-variable calculus course to visualize things like cross-sections of surfaces, partial and directional derivatives, contour plots, gradients, etc. It will be expanded on as the course continues. The other files include tools for visualizing quadric surfaces and parametric curves (and concepts surrounding them). 

Eventually, I will wrap all of these together into one graphing tool. 

Using these files of course requires Rhinocerous, which is a closed-source 3D modelling program. These tools were developed for my own use, but I hope others will be able to make use of them as well. It is unfortunate, but unavoidable, that Rhino is not free, so there is a built in barrier here for access. However, Rhino offers a 90-day trial (and reduced pricing for educators), so that is an option to consider if you want to try this out.

TO USE:

Open Rhino, then open Grasshopper (type "grasshoppper", hit enter). From Grasshopper, open the file surface_plotter.gh.
